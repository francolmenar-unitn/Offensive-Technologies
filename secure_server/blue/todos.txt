Blue:
    1 Mysql installation is faulty since db can only be accessed with root privileges. To fix:
        1.1 sudo mysql -u root => enter in mysql as the root user
            1.1.1 DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
            1.1.2 CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<root password>';
            1.1.3 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
            1.1.4 FLUSH PRIVILEGES
            Exit and enter without sudo

    2 Add new mysql user with reduced privileges for web application:
        2.1     CREATE USER 'ctf2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
        2.2     GRANT SELECT ON ctf2.users TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.3     GRANT SELECT ON ctf2.transfers TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.4     GRANT UPDATE ON ctf2.users TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.5     GRANT UPDATE ON ctf2.transfers TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.6     GRANT INSERT ON ctf2.users TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.7     GRANT INSERT ON ctf2.transfers TO 'ctf2'@'localhost';
        2.8     cd /var/www/html && sudo nano process.php
        2.9     change user and password in new mysqli()

    3 Change table fields:
        3.1 Transfers table: Add foreign key from user to users.user. => will not work because engine is myisam.
        3.2 Users table: Change password length in order to introduce hashing.

    4 Web Application weaknesses:
        4.1 Lacks authentication => can deposit and withdraw from any user by specifying a random password.
        4.2 SQL Injection => user field when checking for the balance.
            Fix: Add prepared statements
        4.3 In withdraw the amount is inserted with a - => if negative value is inserted then it becomes a deposit.
            Also the other way around is possible.
        4.4 Password is in clear => use hashing (sha256 + salt).
