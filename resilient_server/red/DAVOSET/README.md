DAVOSET - it is console (command line) tool for conducting DDoS attacks on the sites via Abuse of Functionality and XML External Entities vulnerabilities at other sites.

About such attacks you can read in my article "Using of the sites for attacks on other sites" (http://websecurity.com.ua/4322/).
